<h1>Camelids</h1>
<div class="Text">
    The four Llamas and two camels are camelids. Camelids tend to be large and are strictly herbivorous.
    Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways. They have a three-chambered rather than a four-chambered digestive 
    tract; an upper lip that is split in two with each part separately mobile; and an isolated
    incisor in the upper jaw. They have long legs that, because they lack tensor skin to bridge
    een thigh and body, look longer still. (from Wikipedia)
